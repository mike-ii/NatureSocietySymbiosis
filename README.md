# Nature & Society Symbiosis

The goal of this project is to propose ideas and studies that would allow for the "merging" of nature and society. 
The idea is to replace as much as possible with natural or genetically modified means. An example would be using algae to produce fuel and bacteria to decompose waste. 

The following is a list of examples of things that should incorporate life forms other than humans to achieve the same goal.

1) Electricty production, storage and distribution.
2) Waste management (decomposition, recycling, repurposing).
3) Creating a healthy atmosphere, drinking water supply and living environment for humans.
4) Using biodegradable materials.

Nature & Society Symbiosis also covers methods of creating a green planet, such as recycling, reducing materialism, renewable energy and reforestation.
