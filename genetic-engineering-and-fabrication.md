# Genetic Engineering and Fabrication

Genetic engineering and fabricating organism DNA from the ground up would allow humans to completely control nature in such a way that would better allow us to 

integrate nature into society even further. For example: Say you can create an organism from the ground up. You could create an organism (A) that would decompose waste

into it's base components such as nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, metals, etc. And then you could create an organism (B) to take the waste from organism A and organize it into

processable mediums. For the sake of this argument, organism B could be a plant which stores different substances in different parts of its'd body, like storing nitrogen in seeds, sugar

and other carbons in it's fruit, potasium in its leafs, calcium in its stem and other substances in its roots. This plant could then be harvested and separated into its

components which can then be processed further.


This argument isn't intended to be scientifically sound, but to show just how important the study of genetics is to integrating nature with society, and how many

possibilities it could bring to the table.


## Some other possibilities:

1) Algae that can produce methane for fuel and be condenced into food, fertelizer, etc.
2) Bacteria that can decompose biological or garabase waste.
3) Some unknown method (or just unknown to me) to convert the process of photosynthesis into electricity
